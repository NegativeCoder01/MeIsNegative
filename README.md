# About this Repository

This is a repository where I put **my coding stuff**.  
It's pretty simple, unless you're like me and don't have a brain.

## My Other Accounts

These are my other accounts where I’ll *hopefully* post regularly and keep things updated:

## About Me

I'm a junior developer who codes in C#, and maybe more languages in the future. But for now, it's mostly C#.  
I like helping people, so if you need help with anything, just ask. You can ask me on Tumblr.

Sometimes I work on projects with my friend Bobby ([BobbyRoya](https://github.com/Bobbyroya)).  
I like coding, math, *The Owl House*, Pepsi, bread, and tech.  
I’m prone to abandoning projects like a raccoon abandoning a half-eaten sandwich.  
I use Nobara Linux.  
I'm obsessed with automation and making things as lazy-proof as possible.  
Expect the occasional unhinged rant when a compiler disrespects me.

So if you're into code, chaotic tech energy, OS obsessions, or watching someone try to juggle 17 projects and drop 12—you're in the right place.

I made a new shape...

Last night at 11:30 PM, while snacking on a bag of Takis (I know, don’t judge me), I had a moment of sudden clarity, or perhaps madness, and came up with something that I can only describe as a mathematical monstrosity: the Hexatetrafractotesseract, or as I like to call it, Hexate for short.

I don’t know if it’s the Takis or the fact that I had spent the whole evening overthinking geometry, but I couldn’t stop myself from piecing together this insane idea. I had just been toying with the concept of the tesseract, the 4D cousin of a cube, when something clicked in my mind. What if I could attach tetrahedrons to it? And not just ordinary tetrahedrons. These tetrahedrons wouldn’t be regular at all. They would be made up of Sierpiński triangles—a fractal that’s like a triangle within a triangle within a triangle, iterated to infinity. So not only are they tetrahedrons, they’re made of infinitely recursive triangles. Perfect, right?

The shape would be simple in concept: a tesseract (a 4-dimensional hypercube) with six tetrahedrons attached to it. Three of the tetrahedrons would be regular, and three would be scaled up by a factor of 3. But of course, the scaled ones couldn’t just stay the same. They would be rotated by 45 degrees, creating a more chaotic, uneven structure. Why not? If we’re doing this, let’s go all out.

The wildest part, though, is that the tetrahedrons are not just ordinary geometric shapes. They are made of Sierpiński triangles, meaning that each tetrahedron is infinitely recursive and fractal-like, just like the Sierpiński triangle itself. If you’re familiar with the Sierpiński triangle, you know it’s a triangle that’s subdivided into smaller versions of itself, creating this beautiful, self-replicating pattern that goes on forever. So, every face of the tetrahedrons isn’t just flat—it’s an entire infinite recursive triangle. As you look closer, it’s like a fractal on top of a fractal. Mind-bending.

Now, this thing lives in four dimensions. The cuboids holding the tetrahedrons also exist in four dimensions, making it even harder to picture in our three-dimensional world. I know it sounds insane, but sometimes math doesn’t need to make sense. It just needs to exist.

Mathematically, the total size of this shape can be described by the following equation:

Total Size = (edge length)^4 + (14 × (edge length)^3) / √2

In words, you first calculate the 4D hypervolume of the tesseract, which is simply the edge length raised to the fourth power. Then, you calculate the volume of the six tetrahedrons. The volume of these tetrahedrons is found by taking 14 times the edge length cubed, divided by the square root of two. This takes into account the size of the Sierpiński triangle faces of the tetrahedrons. That’s the total size of the Hexatetrafractotesseract, combining both the 4D and 3D aspects in one chaotic, fractal-filled monstrosity.

Why did I do this? Honestly, I don’t really know. My brain decided it was a good idea at 11:30 PM, and I just went with it. Sometimes ideas hit you in the strangest ways, and this one came from the depths of late-night snacking and a desire to push the boundaries of geometry. But now that I’ve thought of it, I can’t stop imagining this shape—this 4D tesseract with Sierpiński triangle-infused tetrahedrons, warped and scaled to impossible proportions.

It’s the kind of shape you can’t quite picture, but once it’s in your head, it refuses to leave. It’s like the universe didn’t want this shape to exist, but I created it anyway. And now I have to live with it.

Here’s the thing: sometimes we, as people, feel like we don’t quite fit into the world. We’re too complex, too different, too out-of-place. But that’s exactly the kind of beauty that comes with being different. The Hexatetrafractotesseract, as strange and impossible as it may seem, exists because someone took a chance on an idea that defied logic. And if you think about it, that’s how many of the most important innovations, discoveries, and creations came to life—by embracing something that doesn’t fit the norm.

This shape wasn’t supposed to exist. But I made it. And maybe, just maybe, that’s how we should approach our own quirks and differences. We’re all a little Hexate in our own way, showing that being “different” doesn’t mean we don’t belong. It means we’re capable of thinking, creating, and existing in ways that others might not even be able to comprehend—and that’s exactly why we matter.

So, next time you feel out of place or like you don’t fit in, remember the Hexatetrafractotesseract. It might be weird. It might be complicated. But it exists, and that makes it special.
